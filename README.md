# The-Financial-AI
An AI Trading system. (Part of Udacity's AI For Trading nano-degree)


This repo contains my work to Udacity nanodegree [AI for Trading](https://confirm.udacity.com/HZHKGJYS).

### 1. Sentiment Analysis with NLP on Financial Statements:
Apply Natural Language Processing on corporate filings, such as 10Q and 10K statements, from cleaning data and text processing, to feature extraction and modeling. Utilize bag-of-words and TF-IDF to generate company-specific sentiments. Based on the sentiments, decide which company to invest in, and the optimal time to buy or sell.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis with Neural Network:
Build deep neural networks to process news data. Use different ways of embedding words into vectors. Construct and train LSTM networks for sentiment classification. Backtests and apply the models to news data for signal generation.

### 3. Combining Signals for enhanced alpha:
Learn how to branching decision tree using entropy and information gain. Learn Type 1 and Type 2 errors, Precision vs. Recall, Cross validation for time series, and using learning curve to determine underfitting and overfitting.

### 4. Backtesting:
Build a realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. Use performance attribution to identify the major drivers of your portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL).
